# Domain Whitening Transform for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (CVPR 2019)


Official PyTorch github repository for the paper [Unsupervised Domain Adaptation using Feature-Whitening and Consensus Loss](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/html/Roy_Unsupervised_Domain_Adaptation_Using_Feature-Whitening_and_Consensus_Loss_CVPR_2019_paper.html) published in The Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (**CVPR**) held at Long Beach, California in June, 2019.

### Prerequisites
* Pytorch 1.0
* Python 3.5

### Usage
To run the experiments on the [OfficeHome](http://hemanthdv.org/OfficeHome-Dataset/) dataset first you need to download the dataset from [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B81rNlvomiwed0V1YUxQdC1uOTg/view) page. Following this step, you would need to download the ResNet50 pre-trained checkpoint, trained on ImageNet with the BatchNorm layers (in the first conv layer and the first Res block) replaced by *whitening* normalization layers. The pre-trained weights is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Iw3pCXdiAiJJnZDzh7UToBNQipIVeMS2/view?usp=sharing).
